# Browse Image File Upload

## Overview
This project implements a simple image upload feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can browse and select an image file from their local storage, and the image is displayed dynamically within the application. Additionally, the wrapper container adjusts its size dynamically to fit the uploaded image's dimensions. The feature also includes an option to close the displayed image and reset the container.

## Features
- **Browse and Upload Image:** Allows users to select and display an image file from their local storage.
- **Dynamic Wrapper Resizing:** Automatically resizes the container to match the dimensions of the uploaded image.
- **Close and Reset Functionality:** Users can remove the uploaded image and reset the container to its default dimensions.
- **Responsive and Accessible Design:** Includes responsive styles to ensure the component works well across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structure of the upload interface.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout, including responsive design for the wrapper and upload button.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for handling file uploads, dynamic resizing, and interactivity.

## How to Use
1. Open the application in a browser.
2. Click on the "Browse File" button to select an image from your local storage.
3. The uploaded image will be displayed, and the container will resize to match the image's dimensions.
4. Click the close button (`X`) to remove the image and reset the container.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multiple File Uploads:** Add support for uploading and displaying multiple images.
